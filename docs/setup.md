possibilities on the [configuration and customization page](configuration.md)

- Use the `/scan` command to scan the messages in a channel for thank phrases. This will backfill your reputations. You
  can scan up to 100k messages in a channel. This will take some time, and you can only scan one channel at a time. 
  The scan might cancel at some time once discord takes too long to deliver the requested messages.

  discord emote. you can also add more additional emotes with `/reactions add`.
