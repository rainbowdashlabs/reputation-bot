# Motivation

This bot was created for the [DevCord Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gfEsr79d9a). \
We needed a way to identify valuable users in our community. Most bots do these by chat activity.\
Sadly chat a high activity doesn't mean that a user is valuable for the community.\
That is where the reputation bot comes in place.

# How does it work

The reputation bot will scan messages for thank phrases, which you can define.\
When a thank phrase is found the bot will try to find the receiver of the message. This is done by several checks.

You can find more about the bot on our [website](https://rainbowdashlabs.github.io/reputation-bot/).
