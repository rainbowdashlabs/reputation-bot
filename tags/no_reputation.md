# Why can't I give reputation to user XY?

This can have several reasons:

- The user is not in the context for this message
- You gave reputation to this user recently
- This user gave reputation to you recently

To thank a user make sure that:

- The user has written at least one message after a message of you
- The message of the user you want to thank is not too old (How old depends on the server settings)
- You haven't received reputation from this user shortly

You can also give reputation to users you currently share or recently shared a voice channel with.
